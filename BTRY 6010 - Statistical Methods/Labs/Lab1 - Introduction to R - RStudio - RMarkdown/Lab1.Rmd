## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

In this part we include the analysis from the Lab 1: 


```{r}
# clean all
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))# for remove all the objects
# Ask for help
?plot
?googleVis
# generar una variable
a <-1 # option 1
c=2 # option 2
# operators
3/2
3*2
b <- 3/2
b
# for sequences
w <- 1:10
z <- w*w
z
v <- (1:10)+2
v
# to make a plot
?plot
plot(x=w, y=z)
plot(x=w, y=z, main = "My favorite plot", col = "blue")
# change one specific element in the sequence
z[5]
z[15]
z[5] <- 100
```
