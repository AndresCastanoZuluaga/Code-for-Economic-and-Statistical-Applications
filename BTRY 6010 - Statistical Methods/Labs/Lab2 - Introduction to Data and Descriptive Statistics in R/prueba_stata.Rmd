## Setting-up the Stata Engine 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(knitr)
statapath <- "/Applications/Stata/StataMP.app/Contents/MacOS/"
opts_chunk$set(engine="stata", engine.path=statapath, comment="")
```

To avoid that the data is presented with adornement, we just run the above code chunk
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(engine="stata", comment="")
```


```{r}
sysuse auto 
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
